    <p>Avengers Campus is a Marvel Cinematic Universe themed area located at Disney California Adventure, 
    and being developed for Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. The 
    Marvel-themed areas or "lands" will be developed simultaneously at the three parks and inspired by the Marvel 
    Cinematic Universe. However, they will instead take place in the "Marvel Theme Park Universe", an alternate 
    universe parallel to it within the Marvel Multiverse, in which the Blip and related ensuing events introduced 
    in Avengers: Infinity War did not occur. They are designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, in collaboration with 
    Marvel Studios and Marvel Themed Entertainment.</p>

    <br><p>A Bug's Land closed on September 5, 2018, to make way for the new area. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Disney announced 
    the Guardians of the Galaxy attraction would be joined by Spider-Man and the Avengers as part of the new 
    immersive superhero-themed area at the park. Disney initially announced on March 11, 2020, that Avengers 
    Campus would open on July 18, 2020, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late December 
    2020, Disney announced that Avengers Campus was scheduled to open in 2021. In April 2021, Disney announced 
    that the area would open on June 4, 2021.</p>
