            <p>
              Our labs have spent years finding that balance of elements to create a fuel based off of renewable resources as compared to fossil fuels, and we've finally done it. Utilizing renewable elements, 4Fuel is a safe alternative to the aviation fuels that currently power our aircrafts (and pollute our air). All that's needed to create 4Fuel is boil a mixture of salt water with a paste formed from plants and use the air released from the boiling as fuel - meaning 4Fuel is a gaseus fuel compared to the typical aviation kerosene, which is a liquid.  With several airlines already supporting 4Fuel, we hope to soon be the main fuel option for aerocrafts.

        <h2>Introducing 4Fuel</h2>
        <p class="mt-1">
            The "4" in 4Fuel derives from the four classical elements: water, earth, fire, and air. This concept of classical elements has been seen throughout thousands of years of human civilization, with it having both practical and philosophical importance in several societies. Incorporating that concept to our product, we wanted 4Fuel to have that same message of practicality and philosophy: the practicality of cost efficiency and the philosophy of sustainability.
            <br><br>
            Now you may be wondering, how precisely is this sustainable? Well, the two main ingredients are plants and water, which are renewable resources, and we even use solar energy at our labs to generate the heat needed for boiling! In addition to using renewable energy, we specifically use dendrocalamus giganteus and lemnoideae for our plant mixture, commonly known as giant bamboo and duckweed! The benefits to using giant bamboo and duckweed is that both plants grow incredibly fast (with giant bamboo growing nearly 40cm per day!), meaning we can quickly replant and regrow our resources. No need to cut down plants not found in our headquarter's gardens! 
            <br><br>
            The second question is: how is this cost efficient? Well, as stated previously, 4Fuel only requires very basic forms of classical elements. Salt water makes up 97% of the earth's water, and any type of plant can be used to create the paste needed. The main reason why we use plants is because we need chloroplasts, which is found only in plants. When the chloroplasts mix with salt water in the right conditions, they create that magical formula we call 4Fuel! With such little conditions needed, you'll be able to cut power costs by a substantial amount!            </p>
